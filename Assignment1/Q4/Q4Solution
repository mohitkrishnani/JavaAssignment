1. Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names  of all its employees.  Every  month, an employee  will be chosen at random from these  records to receive  a free toy.
Ans: A List. We can shuffle the list and select the first employee or choose a random index in the range 0 to size()-1 and get employee at that index.

2. WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee  but only first names  will be used,  and each name will be used  only once. Prepare  a list of unique  first names.
Ans: A Set. Using the set interface we can make sure that each element is present only once in the collection.

3. WTI decides that it only wants to use the most popular names for its toys. Count up the number of employees who have each first name.
Ans: Using a Map. The first name of employees would be the keys and the count of employees with that same first name as the value

4. WTI acquires  season tickets  for the local lacrosse  team, to be shared by employees.  Create  a waiting list for this popular sport
Ans: Using a Queue. Queue follows FIFO principle so the employees that would request the tickets first would be given preference.
